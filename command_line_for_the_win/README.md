### CMD CHALLENGE  

CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills.  
Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated.

#### Here are the steps I followed:

    toke the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.  
    Opened a terminal on my local machine.  
    Useed the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment.  
    Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I want to upload the screenshots.  
    I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to the sandbox environment.   
    Once the screenshots were transferred, I proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub.
